#REPLACE all flA with your mutant name.
#put wt sample mzml files in a folder named "wt".  mutants in a folder named "flA"
#paste the following in an R terminal, or source the file using the source() command.  It should work.
#TO make it more/less stringent, change the following parms:
#ppm, peakwidth, snthresh, noise, flAreport$fold > X, flAgood$pvalue < X

#Load the package
library(xcms)
###noise is just a signal cutoff, it dramatically decreases the # of peaks.  I think somewhere between 1000-2000 is apropos.
flA<-xcmsSet("wt_vs_flA", method="centWave",ppm=10, peakwidth=c(10,30), snthresh = 10, noise = 1500)
#Associate peaks across samples based on m/z and retention time.
flA2<-group(flA)
#Apply retention time correction
flA3<-retcor(flA2,family="s",plottype="m")
flA3<-group(flA3)
###I wonder why they do retcor twice?
flA4<-retcor(flA3,family="s",plottype="m")
###bw does some sort of chromatogram smoothing
flA4<-group(flA4,bw=10)
#Fill regions with no signal
flA5<-fillPeaks(flA4)
#Perform differential analysis
flAreport <-  diffreport (flA5)

#Apply various cutoff stuff.  We want
flAgood = flAreport[flAreport$fold >10, ]
flAgood = flAgood[flAgood$pvalue <0.01,]
wt_ave = rowMeans(flAgood[,19:23])
flA_ave = rowMeans(flAgood[,14:18])
flAgood = cbind(flAgood, wt_ave,flA_ave)

###Pull EICs.  Unfortunately I think the default is a 0.01 Da XIC window and it is inconvenient to change.
credible.eic.raw = getEIC(flA5, rt = "raw", groupidx=as.character(flAgood$name))

###plot EIC of the first "credible ID", will only plot one at a time
plot(credible.eic.raw, flA5,groupidx=as.character(flAgood$name)[1])


###loop plot, keypress to advance per pic; could change plot command to save EICs to a file
#for (i in 1:length(flAgood$name)){
#    plot(credible.eic.raw, flA5, groupidx=as.character(flAgood$name)[i])
#    cat ("Press [enter] to continue")
#    line <- readline()
#}
```
