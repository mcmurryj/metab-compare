#REPLACE all XXXXX with your mutant name.
#put wt sample mzml files in a folder named "wt".  mutants in a folder named "XXXXX"
#paste the following in an R terminal, or source the file using the source() command.  It should work.
#TO make it more/less stringent, change the following parms:
#ppm, peakwidth, snthresh, noise, XXXXXreport$fold > X, XXXXXgood$pvalue < X

#Load the package
library(xcms)
###noise is just a signal cutoff, it dramatically decreases the # of peaks.  I think somewhere between 1000-2000 is apropos.
XXXXX<-xcmsSet("wt_vs_XXXXX", method="centWave",ppm=10, peakwidth=c(10,30), snthresh = 10, noise = 1500)
#Associate peaks across samples based on m/z and retention time.
XXXXX2<-group(XXXXX)
#Apply retention time correction
XXXXX3<-retcor(XXXXX2,family="s",plottype="m")
XXXXX3<-group(XXXXX3)
###I wonder why they do retcor twice?
XXXXX4<-retcor(XXXXX3,family="s",plottype="m")
###bw does some sort of chromatogram smoothing
XXXXX4<-group(XXXXX4,bw=10)
#Fill regions with no signal
XXXXX5<-fillPeaks(XXXXX4)
#Perform differential analysis
XXXXXreport <-  diffreport (XXXXX5)

#Apply various cutoff stuff.  We want
XXXXXgood = XXXXXreport[XXXXXreport$fold >10, ]
XXXXXgood = XXXXXgood[XXXXXgood$pvalue <0.01,]
wt_ave = rowMeans(XXXXXgood[,19:23])
XXXXX_ave = rowMeans(XXXXXgood[,14:18])
XXXXXgood = cbind(XXXXXgood, wt_ave,XXXXX_ave)

###Pull EICs.  Unfortunately I think the default is a 0.01 Da XIC window and it is inconvenient to change.
credible.eic.raw = getEIC(XXXXX5, rt = "raw", groupidx=as.character(XXXXXgood$name))

###plot EIC of the first "credible ID", will only plot one at a time
plot(credible.eic.raw, XXXXX5,groupidx=as.character(XXXXXgood$name)[1])


###loop plot, keypress to advance per pic; could change plot command to save EICs to a file
for (i in 1:length(XXXXXgood$name)){
    plot(credible.eic.raw, XXXXX5, groupidx=as.character(XXXXXgood$name)[i])
    cat ("Press [enter] to continue")
    line <- readline()
}
